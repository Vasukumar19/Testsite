# Testsite
1. My Development Process
I started by researching different Bootstrap 5 components to find a look that felt modern and professional. I spent time comparing different card styles and form layouts until I found a combination that worked well together. Once the visual style was set, I built the structure for all three pages simultaneously to ensure that the navigation and branding stayed consistent across the entire site.

2. Tools & AI Assistance
To make the process more efficient, I used Claude (Sonnet model) as a coding assistant. It was particularly helpful for generating the initial boilerplate and setting up the responsive grid quickly. I also spent a good amount of time in the Bootstrap documentation to make sure I was using the utility classes correctly for spacing and alignment. I didn't just copy-paste; I actively tweaked the AI-generated code to change the animations and adjust the color palette to my specific vision.

3. Challenges & Problem Solving
My biggest hurdle is usually the styling phase—getting custom CSS to behave exactly how I want can be frustrating. However, because I committed to using Bootstrap’s full grid system this time, it was much easier to manage. When I ran into issues with how the cards looked on mobile, I used the AI to help me refine the media queries and animation triggers, which solved the problem much faster than if I had done it manually.

4. Learning Journey
It’s been a while since I focused on frontend work, so this project was a great way to get back into the swing of things. My biggest takeaway was learning how to balance speed with quality. Using a framework like Bootstrap alongside an AI tool allowed me to focus on the "big picture"—like user experience and overall design—rather than getting stuck on a single line of CSS. It felt good to see a professional-looking site come together so quickly.

5. Project Timeline
Total Time Taken: Approximately 2 hours.
